<h1 class="mt-5">Student Registration System</h1>
This was a class project to create a Java EE and eventually Java Spring web application for students to create an account, register for classes and for admins to run reports. This project started out as a Java EE project using an MVC design pattern. The data was persisted with an H2 database and was deployed using Wildfly server. The project was eventually upgraded to a Java spring application deployed to Apache Tomcat.

Login security was provided by a username/password that was checked by a SQL query to the H2 database.

The user could register to a class based on their selection if the class was not full. If the class was full, they would receive an error page with the option to return to the class registration page.
